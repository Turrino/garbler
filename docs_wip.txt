Breadcrumbs
	Main level >
		Crumbsets: templates, characters, locations, etc >
			Crumblists: a list of positional elements >
				Positional Element: a word or sentence to be used as building block. e.g. 1/2/3rd component of a name or sentence.
				Subset: expands a single positional element into a list of positional elements that can be used for contextual reasons (e.g. male/female).
				Can be any lenght.
		
	Specific Crumbsets > 
		event_patterns: a set of joined crumblists that determines the flair of an event, e.g. a sudden apparition, stopping at a place, etc.
			It does not determine the outcome or the mood of the event, it is only needed to restrict the amount of building blocks to a coherent set.

To do's:
- Schema check on the breadcrums, e.g.: a single item in a crumlist in an event crumbset can be a single item (1 item = universal mood, gets picked regardless),
	or a list. If it is a list, it must have 3 items (mood subsets).
	Otherwise the garbler might crash at runtime if it tries to fetch a mood that does not exist.
